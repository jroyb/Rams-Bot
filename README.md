# Rams-Bot
Ryerson Engineering Discord Server BOT

When posting rules, just do it locally on your PC by
uncommenting the elif !postRules block.

Since you cannot post more than 2048 character (or words?)
for the rules, you have to send the rules in multiple 
embed messages. Just edit the code to do so. It's 
inefficient but this problem is too small to require a
complete overhaul anyways.

master-branch on this github is for local use. Deployed
and production version of Rams-bot is in the heroku branch.
